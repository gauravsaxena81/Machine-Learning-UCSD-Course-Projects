0. Do GD as well. 
XXXX1. Add regularization to SGD
XXXXX2. Add cross validation functionality
XXXXX3. Do a grid search for various U values on 1.
4. Do L-BFGS with L2 regularization

For all above,
1. Apply all three algo to test data
2. Apply to test as well

Graphs (GD(maybe) vs SGD vs LBFGS):
1. Number of iterations for convergence(Bar Chart)
2. Measure of overfitting
3. Convergence of algorithms
4. After convergence, accuracy achieved on training and test data and validation set.
